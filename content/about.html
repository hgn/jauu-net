<p>
Hello, and welcome! I'm Hagen Paul Pfeifer, Chief Software Architect
specializing in the architectural design and strategic oversight of complex
software systems and business divisions. My journey in software is defined by
the creation of robust digital solutions that not only function effectively but
also drive innovation and progress in the tech world - under the many
constraints of economics, maintainability, innovation or sustainability!
</p>

<img src="/images/hgn-profile.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="float: right; width: auto; height: 220px; margin-left: 20px;">

<p>
In my role, I lead diverse teams, merging different disciplines to forge paths
to success. There's a unique joy in collaborating with passionate individuals,
each contributing their expertise. 
</p>

<p>
At the core of my expertise lies a deep-rooted understanding of software, with
particular strengths in the Linux kernel, software analysis, security, embedded
systems and network protocols. These areas are not just specialties for me;
they are the pillars upon which I build scalable and efficient systems.
</p>

<p>
I've played an active role in shaping the standards of TCP, IPv6, and BGPv4,
contributing to the evolution of the internet as we know it. My contributions
to the Linux kernel are focused yet varied, touching on the network stack,
tracing, perf, epoll, kvm hypervisor, among other subsystems.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the technical realm, I am passionate about knowledge sharing. This has
led to my involvement in writing articles for Heise, delivering talks at
various conferences, organize conferences and participating in esteemed
organizations such as the ACM and the German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft
f√ºr Informatik e.V.).
</p>

<p>
Whether you are exploring cutting-edge software solutions or simply interested
in the ever-evolving world of technology, I hope you find this space
insightful. Welcome to my corner of the digital universe.
