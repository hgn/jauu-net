<p>
Hello, and welcome! I’m Hagen Paul Pfeifer, Chief Software Strategist based
in Munich. My focus spans enterprise-wide technology strategy, engineering
governance, and the standardisation of processes and development practices. I
specialise in the architectural design and strategic oversight of complex
software systems, building robust digital solutions that not only work reliably
but also drive innovation—always under real-world constraints of economics,
maintainability, security, and sustainability.

<p>
In my role, I lead diverse teams, merging different disciplines to forge paths
to success. There's a unique joy in collaborating with passionate individuals,
each contributing their expertise. 
</p>
-->

<p>
At the core of my expertise is a deep understanding of software, with
particular strengths in operating systems like the Linux kernel, software
analysis, security, embedded systems, and network protocols. These aren’t just
specialties—they’re the pillars I use to design scalable, efficient systems.
</p>

<p>
I’ve contributed to the shaping of TCP, IPv6, and BGPv4 standards, helping to
evolve the modern internet. My upstream Linux kernel work spans several
subsystems, including the network stack, tracing, perf, epoll, and the KVM
hypervisor.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the purely technical, I care about sharing knowledge: I write for heise,
deliver talks, organise conferences, and participate in professional
communities such as ACM and the German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für
Informatik e. V.).
</p>

<p>
Whether you are exploring cutting-edge software solutions or simply interested
in the ever-evolving world of technology, I hope you find this space
insightful. Welcome to my corner of the digital universe.
