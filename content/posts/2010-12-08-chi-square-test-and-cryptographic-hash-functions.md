The Chi-Square probe is a statistical hypothesis test. The here presented
values show the distribution of several hash algorithms compared to the
cryptographic SHA1. Currently I am too lazy to explain the algorithm in great detail.
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-square_test) is a great source for an introduction.

The analysis is part of [libhashish](http://libhashish.sf.net) and available in the analysis directory.
