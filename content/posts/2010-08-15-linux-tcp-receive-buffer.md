just for the protocol: Linux memory management is terrible complex. Many hidden
relations to and from other components in an optimized form that prevent anyone
from beeing productive. {Free,Net,Open}BSD code is much more coherent and
easier to understand. It is even difficult to write a proper commit message in
a understandably way that more then 4 people understand why I modified the code
in this way.
