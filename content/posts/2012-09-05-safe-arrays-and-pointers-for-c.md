John Nagle (no, not the TCP Nagle ;-) proposed a extension to C to keep array information over the call
context to do bounds checks. His proposal [Safe Arrays and Pointers for C through compatible additions to the language](http://www.animats.com/papers/languages/safearraysforc41.pdf) is a nice
reading. On the GCC maillinglist the responses are mixed: more questions and
doubts if such a extension will and can be adopted by the users.
