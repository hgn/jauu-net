This blog used two third party extensions:


* Google Analytics
* Disqus


Both set cookies and have a user coverage which is horrible. Nowadays Google
Analytics together with Google Search, Android activity and Google Ads have a
database of ... in the end they know too much about you.


I decided today that web analysis data is not crucial for me compared to the
privacy of my readers. So I removed all third party content from my blog.

By the way: I suggest two Google Chrome extensions:


* Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on (by Google), Tells the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) not to send information to Google
* Ghostery, Protect your privacy. See who's tracking your web browsing with Ghostery.
