I never realized it because it is courteous in open source projects with more
then one programmer to write a meaningful commit message (this is no matter of course
in commercial projects). I just noticed that git prints the following message:



```
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch kvm-accelerator
[...]

```

Quite nice ... ;)
