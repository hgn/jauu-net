The posted flash advisory list is really long so I tried to update the player.
But unfortunately Adobe skipped their 64 bit
"support":<http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/64bit.html> (what a
piece of software is this anyway - in 2010?) which actually means I had no
change to run flash any more! 32 bit combat mode - no thank you, buggy software
- no thank you. I installed the dev version of
"firefox":<http://nightly.mozilla.org/webm/> with webm support which works
great. OK, many videos aren't rendered yet but this is a question of time.


Let say goodby to Adobe Flash! ;-)
