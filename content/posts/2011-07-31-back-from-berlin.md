Traveling back from Berlin to Munich. This time via City-Night-Train booked in a six-person wagon.
Reading "der Freitag", a Berlin weekly newspaper produced here in Berlin until midnight. One
of Kitas professor suggest the paper.


I took this extended weekend (from Thursday) to arrange our new home in
Weissensee/Berlin. Paint the rooms white and the floor in a special mixed
color. Next time I will establish the parquet (84m^2). After that all ground
work is done and the furniture can be ebayed[TM]. ;-)
