Today I buyed a new printer: Epson WP 4535. The printer can scan up to 600 DPI
to a USB device (as JPEG or PDF). A nice feature because I dont want to install
sane or any other scaner software. Printing works out of the box via CUPS. No
additional driver installation required. My room mate tried to test the printer
with Windows which failed. Under Windows you must download the actual driver
from Epson Homepage. No big deal, but with Linux everything works out of the
box! The printer is connected to the homenetwork via WiFI. So there is just
one cable. We currently debate where we can place the printer.

Futher, you can copy documents and send or receive FAX. So first impressions
are quite positiv!
