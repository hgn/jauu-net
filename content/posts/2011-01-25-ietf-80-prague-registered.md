"IETF 80":<http://www.ietf.org/meeting/80/> will be held in Prague - and as a early bird I registered today. The
advantage of Prague is that I am familiar with the city which makes it easy for
me to find a cheaper hotel compared to the standard conference hotels (Hilton:
148 Euro/day, Inter Continental: 140 Euro/day). The hotel in Beijing ("IETF 79":<http://www.ietf.org/meeting/79/>)
for example costed ~1500.- Euro for 9 days. I hope to find a hotel for about
350.- Euro. Looking forward to meet colleagues and IETF maillinglist parter.
