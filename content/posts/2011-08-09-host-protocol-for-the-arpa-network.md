Today a fresh I-D was published, titled: "Host/Host Protocol for the ARPA
Network" from Alexander McKenzie and Steve Crocker; covering Internet history.
Great I-D:


This document reproduces the Host/Host Protocol developed by the ARPA
Network Working Group during 1969, 1970 and 1971. It describes a
protocol used to manage communication between processes residing on
independent Hosts. It addresses issues of multiplexing multiple
streams of communication over a single hardware interface including
addressing, flow control, connection establishment/disestablishment,
and other signaling. It was the official protocol of the ARPA
Network from January 1972 until the switch to TCP/IP in January 1983.
It is offered as an "intended RFC" at this late date to help complete
the historical record available through the RFC series.
